# Usage
1. Edit ``settings.json``. Add your YouTube channel's name and Channel ID to the list.  
2. Also add the path to your ``yt-dlp.exe``.  
3. Start the program, select your channel in the list, and click the button.  
4. Be patient and eventually a ``.tsv`` file should be produced in the program's folder.
